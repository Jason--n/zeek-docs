"If you're doing an upgrade install (rather than a fresh install), there's"
" two suggested approaches: either install Zeek using the same "
"installation prefix directory as before, or pick a new prefix and copy "
"local customizations over."

#: ../../install/guidelines.rst:13
msgid ""
"In the following we summarize general guidelines for upgrading, see the "
":ref:`release-notes` for version-specific information."

msgid ""
"If you choose to configure and install Zeek with the same prefix "
"directory as before, first stop all running Zeek instances in your "
"cluster (if using ZeekControl, issue the \"zeekctl stop\" command on the "
"manager host).  Next, make a backup of the Zeek install prefix directory."

#: ../../install/guidelines.rst:25
msgid ""
"During the upgrade, any file in the install prefix may be overwritten or "
"removed, except for local customization of files in the "
"``$prefix/share/zeek/site`` and ``$prefix/etc`` directories (``$prefix`` "
"indicating the root of where Zeek was installed).  Also, logs generated "
"at run-time won't be touched by the upgrade."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install/guidelines.rst:32
msgid ""
"After upgrading, remember to check the ``$prefix/share/zeek/site`` and "
"``$prefix/etc`` directories for files with a file extension of "
"``.example``, which indicate that the distribution's version of the file "
"differs from the local one, and therefore, may include local changes.  "
"Review the differences and make adjustments as necessary. Use the new "
"version for differences that aren't a result of a local change."

"Finally, if using ZeekControl, then issue the \"zeekctl deploy\" command."
"  This command will check for any policy script errors, install the new "
"version of Zeek to all machines in your cluster, and then it will start "
"Zeek."

"To install the newer version in a different prefix directory than before,"
" first stop all running Zeek instances in your cluster (if using "
"ZeekControl, then issue a \"zeekctl stop\" command on the manager host)."

"Next, copy local customization and configuration files from the "
"``$prefix/share/zeek/site`` and ``$prefix/etc`` directories to the new "
"location (``$prefix`` indicating the root of where Zeek was originally "
"installed).  Review the files for differences before copying and make "
"adjustments as necessary (use the new version for differences that aren't"
" a result of a local change).  Of particular note, the copied version of "
"``$prefix/etc/zeekctl.cfg`` is likely to need changes to any settings "
"that specify a pathname."
