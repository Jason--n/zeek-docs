"During the process of creating policy scripts the need may arise to find "
"the geographic location for an IP address. Zeek had support for the "
"`GeoIP library <http://www.maxmind.com/app/c>`__ at the policy script "
"level from release 1.3 to 2.5.x to account for this need.  Starting with "
"release 2.6, GeoIP support requires `libmaxminddb "
"<https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/releases>`__. To use this "
"functionality, you need to first install the libmaxminddb software, and "
"then install the GeoLite2 city database before building Zeek."
