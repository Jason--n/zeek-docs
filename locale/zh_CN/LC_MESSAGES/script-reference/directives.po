"The Zeek scripting language supports a number of directives that can "

"Marks the current script as deprecated. This can be placed anywhere in "

"Loads the specified Zeek script, specified as the relative pathname of "

msgid ""
"The purpose of this directive is to ensure that all script dependencies "
"are satisfied, and to avoid having to list every needed Zeek script on "
"the command-line.  Zeek keeps track of which scripts have been loaded, so"
" it is not an error to load a script more than once (once a script has "
"been loaded, any subsequent ``load`` directives for that script are "
"ignored)."

"By default, Zeek will automatically activate all dynamic plugins found in"
" the plugin search path (the search path can be changed by setting the "
"environment variable ``ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH`` to a colon-separated list of "

"activated only by using ``load-plugin`` or by specifying the full plugin "
"name on the Zeek command-line (e.g., ``zeek Demo::Rot13`` or by setting "
"the environment variable ``ZEEK_PLUGIN_ACTIVATE`` to a comma-separated "
"list of plugin names."

"This works similarly to ``load`` except that in this case the filename "

"extension in the ``load-sigs`` directive.  The filename cannot contain "
"any whitespace."

"The way this works is that after Zeek parses all script files, then for "
"each loaded script Zeek will take the absolute path of the script and "
"then it removes the portion of the directory path that is in Zeek's file "
"search path.  Then it replaces each ``/`` character with a period ``.`` "
"and then prepends the prefix (specified in the ``@prefixes`` directive) "
"followed by a period.  The resulting filename is searched for in each "
"directory in Zeek's file search path.  If a matching file is found, then "
"the file is automatically loaded."

"For example, if a script called ``local.zeek`` has been loaded, and a "
