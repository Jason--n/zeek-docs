"This script enables logging of packet segment data when a protocol "
"parsing violation is encountered.  The amount of data from the packet "
"logged is set by the :zeek:see:`DPD::packet_segment_size` variable. A "
"caveat to logging packet data is that in some cases, the packet may not "
"be the packet that actually caused the protocol violation."
