"This script logs evidence regarding the degree to which the packet "
"capture process suffers from measurement loss. The loss could be due to "
"overload on the host or NIC performing the packet capture or it could "
"even be beyond the host.  If you are capturing from a switch with a SPAN "
"port, it's very possible that the switch itself could be overloaded and "
"dropping packets. Reported loss is computed in terms of the number of "
"\"gap events\" (ACKs for a sequence number that's above a gap)."
