"This script logs and tracks active services.  For this script, an active "
"service is defined as an IP address and port of a server for which a TCP "
"handshake (SYN+ACK) is observed, assumed to have been done in the past "
"(started seeing packets mid-connection, but the server is actively "
"sending data), or sent at least one UDP packet. If a protocol name is "
"found/known for service, that will be logged, but services whose names "
"can't be determined are also still logged."
