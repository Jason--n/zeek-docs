"This script manages the tracking/logging of general information regarding"
" TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic.  For UDP and ICMP, \"connections\" are to be"
" interpreted using flow semantics (sequence of packets from a source "
"host/port to a destination host/port).  Further, ICMP \"ports\" are to be"
" interpreted as the source port meaning the ICMP message type and the "
"destination port being the ICMP message code."
