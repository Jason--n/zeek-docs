"This script can be used to extract either the originator's data or the "
"responders data or both.  By default nothing is extracted, and in order "
"to actually extract data the ``c$extract_orig`` and/or the "
"``c$extract_resp`` variable must be set to ``T``.  One way to achieve "
"this would be to handle the :zeek:id:`connection_established` event "
"elsewhere and set the ``extract_orig`` and ``extract_resp`` options "
"there. However, there may be trouble with the timing due to event queue "
"delay."
