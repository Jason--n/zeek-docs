"GridFTP control channels are identified by FTP control channels that "
"successfully negotiate the GSSAPI method of an AUTH request and for which"
" the exchange involved an encoded TLS/SSL handshake, indicating the GSI "
"mechanism for GSSAPI was used.  This analysis is all supported "
"internally, this script simply adds the \"gridftp\" label to the "
"*service* field of the control channel's :zeek:type:`connection` record."

msgid ""
"GridFTP data channels are identified by a heuristic that relies on the "
"fact that default settings for GridFTP clients typically mutually "
"authenticate the data channel with TLS/SSL and negotiate a NULL bulk "
"cipher (no encryption). Connections with those attributes are marked as "
"GridFTP if the data transfer within the first two minutes is big enough "
"to indicate a GripFTP data channel that would be undesirable to analyze "
"further (e.g. stop TCP reassembly).  A side effect is that true "
"connection sizes are not logged, but at the benefit of saving CPU cycles "
"that would otherwise go to analyzing the large (and likely benign) "
"connections."
