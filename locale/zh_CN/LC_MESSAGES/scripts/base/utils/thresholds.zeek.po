"Functions for using multiple thresholds with a counting tracker.  For "
"example, you may want to generate a notice when something happens 10 "
"times and again when it happens 100 times but nothing in between.  You "
"can use the :zeek:id:`check_threshold` function to define your threshold "
"points and the :zeek:type:`TrackCount` variable where you are keeping "
"track of your counter."
