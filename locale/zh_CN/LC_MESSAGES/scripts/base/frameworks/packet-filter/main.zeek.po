"This script supports how Zeek sets its BPF capture filter.  By default "
"Zeek sets a capture filter that allows all traffic.  If a filter is set "
"on the command line, that filter takes precedence over the default open "
"filter and all filters defined in Zeek scripts with the "
":zeek:id:`capture_filters` and :zeek:id:`restrict_filters` variables."
