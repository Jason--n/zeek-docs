"A framework for establishing and controlling a cluster of Zeek instances."
" In order to use the cluster framework, a script named ``cluster-"
"layout.zeek`` must exist somewhere in Zeek's script search path which has"
" a cluster definition of the :zeek:id:`Cluster::nodes` variable. The "
"``CLUSTER_NODE`` environment variable or :zeek:id:`Cluster::node` must "
"also be sent and the cluster framework loaded as a package like ``@load "
"base/frameworks/cluster``."
