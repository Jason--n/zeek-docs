"The notice framework enables Zeek to \"notice\" things which are odd or "
"potentially bad, leaving it to the local configuration to define which of"
" them are actionable.  This decoupling of detection and reporting allows "
"Zeek to be customized to the different needs that sites have."

"This is the notice framework which enables Zeek to \"notice\" things "
"which are odd or potentially bad.  Decisions of the meaning of various "
"notices need to be done per site because Zeek does not ship with "
"assumptions about what is bad activity for sites.  More extensive "
"documentation about using the notice framework can be found in "
":doc:`/frameworks/notice`."

"This script provides a default set of actions to take for \"weird "
"activity\" events generated from Zeek's event engine.  Weird activity is "
"defined as unusual or exceptional activity that can indicate malformed "
"connections, traffic that doesn't conform to a particular protocol, "
"malfunctioning or misconfigured hardware, or even an attacker attempting "
"to avoid/confuse a sensor.  Without context, it's hard to judge whether a"
" particular category of weird activity is interesting, but this script "
"provides a starting point for the user."

"This script adds geographic location data to notices for the \"remote\" "
