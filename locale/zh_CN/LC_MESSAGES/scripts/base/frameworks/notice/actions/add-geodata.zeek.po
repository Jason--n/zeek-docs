"This script adds geographic location data to notices for the \"remote\" "
"host in a connection.  It does make the assumption that one of the "
"addresses in a connection is \"local\" and one is \"remote\" which is "
"probably a safe assumption to make in most cases.  If both addresses are "
"remote, it will use the $src address."
