"The software framework provides infrastructure for maintaining a table of"

"This script provides the framework for software version detection and "
"parsing but doesn't actually do any detection on it's own.  It relies on "
"other protocol specific scripts to parse out software from the protocols "
"that they analyze.  The entry point for providing new software detections"
" to this framework is through the :zeek:id:`Software::found` function."
