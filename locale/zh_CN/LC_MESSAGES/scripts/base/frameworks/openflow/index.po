"This plugin-based framework allows to control OpenFlow capable switches "
"by implementing communication to an OpenFlow controller via plugins. The "
"framework has to be instantiated via the new function in one of the "
"plugins. This framework only offers very low-level functionality; if you "
"want to use OpenFlow capable switches, e.g., for shunting, please look at"
" the NetControl framework, which provides higher level functions and can "
"use the OpenFlow framework as a backend."
