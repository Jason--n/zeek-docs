"Zeek ships with many pre-written scripts that are highly customizable to "
"support traffic analysis for your specific environment.  By default, "
"these will be installed into ``$PREFIX/share/zeek`` and can be identified"
" by the use of a ``.zeek`` file name extension.  These files should "
"**never** be edited directly as changes will be lost when upgrading to "
"newer versions of Zeek.  The exception to this rule is the directory "
"``$PREFIX/share/zeek/site`` where local site-specific files can be put "
"without fear of being clobbered later. The other main script directories "
"under ``$PREFIX/share/zeek`` are ``base`` and ``policy``.  By default, "
"Zeek automatically loads all scripts under ``base`` (unless the ``-b`` "
"command line option is supplied), which deal either with collecting "
"basic/useful state about network activities or providing "
"frameworks/utilities that extend Zeek's functionality without any "
"performance cost.  Scripts under the ``policy`` directory may be more "
"situational or costly, and so users must explicitly choose if they want "
"to load them."

"The typical way a standard Zeek script advertises tweak-able options to "

"to certain ones.  There is a ``policy`` hook that is actually what is "
