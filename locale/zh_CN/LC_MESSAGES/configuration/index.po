"A *Zeek Cluster* is a set of systems jointly analyzing the traffic of a "
"network link in a coordinated fashion.  You can operate such a setup from"
" a central manager system easily using ZeekControl because it hides much "
"of the complexity of the multi-machine installation."

"In this document we refer to the user account used to set up the cluster "
"as the \"Zeek user\".  When setting up a cluster the Zeek user must be "
"set up on all hosts, and this user must have ssh access from the manager "
"to all machines in the cluster, and it must work without being prompted "
"for a password/passphrase (for example, using ssh public key "
"authentication). Also, on the worker nodes this user must have access to "
"the target network interface in promiscuous mode."

"Additional storage must be available on all hosts under the same path, "

"the directory specified with the ``--prefix`` configure option, or "
"``/usr/local/zeek`` by default.  The Zeek user must be able to either "

"When trying to decide how to configure the Zeek nodes, keep in mind that "
"there can be multiple Zeek instances running on the same host.  For "
"example, it's possible to run a proxy and the manager on the same host.  "
"However, it is recommended to run workers on a different machine than the"
" manager because workers can consume a lot of CPU resources.  The maximum"
" recommended number of workers to run on a machine should be one or two "
"less than the number of CPU cores available on that machine.  Using a "
"load-balancing method (such as PF_RING) along with CPU pinning can "
"decrease the load on the worker machines.  Also, in order to reduce the "
"load on the manager process, it is recommended to have a logger in your "
"configuration.  If a logger is defined in your cluster configuration, "
"then it will receive logs instead of the manager process."
